Create archive tarballs and roast them!

# How to install the binaries

Roast contains to binaries
- `raw`
- `recomprizz`
- `roast`
- `roast_scm`

## Cargo

**From source**:
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/openSUSE-Rust/roast
```

**From crates.io**:
```bash
cargo install roast-cli
```

Both commands pull from source. The only difference is that the first one
obviously relies on git.

## Roast - How it works

There are three path behaviours in Roast.
- excluded paths
- additional paths
- included paths

Excluded paths and included paths are **within** the source or target
directory. For example. If we are going to archive the `roast-cli` directory
here, declared paths in the `--exclude` and `--include` paths are relative
to the top-most level directory of the source or target directory e.g. `src/bin/roast.rs`
points to `roast-cli/src/bin/roast.rs`.

One thing to note about the path behaviours is the higher precedence over files than directories.

- If a **directory is INCLUDED while EXCLUDED**, it is, therefore, **IGNORED**.
- If a **file is INCLUDED but it is WITHIN an EXCLUDED directory**, it is,
therefore, **ADDED with the directory created if directory (new parent of
the file) does not exist**.
- If a **directory is ADDED i.e. from outside but resulting destination should
be EXCLUDED**, it is, therefore, **ADDED**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ADDED != INCLUDED. ADDED can either point to any path. INCLUDED always points WITHIN
> the top-most level directory of the source or target directory.

> [!NOTE]
> The reasoning behind the **third point** is that the user may have intended to
use a different source or to include only a specific set of files, thereby
ignoring the top-level directory of the original source.

As of now, the output file's filename MUST INCLUDE the extension. We might want to change this behaviour
in the future where a user will only provide the filename without indicating the extension since
the extension should be based on the compression option.

## Roast SCM - How it works

`roast_scm` is an extended utility of `roast`. Its purpose is to create tarballs from a
remote repository. The behaviour is similar to `roast` but only at some point.

As of now, the filename MUST INCLUDE the extension. We might want to change this behaviour since
`--outfile` has a type `Option<PathBuf>`. Hence, if not provided, it will try to base
the output file's filename from the project name and the revision (i.e. commit hash or tag).

## Raw - How it works

`raw` is an extractor utility. It detects the mime-type instead of basing it from a file extension
before it extracts the tarball archive.

## Recomprizz - How it works

`recomprizz` is a recompression utility. It utilises `roast` and `raw` under the hood. It extracts the
target tarball before it creates a new tarball of a different compression option e.g. `source.tar.gz`
to `source.tar.zst`. The renaming scheme is too dumb and simple though, and not perfectâ€”see note below.

> [!NOTE]
> When using `recomprizz`, files with filenames like `package-1.2.3.tar.gz` will have
> the number parts of their names preserved i.e. `package-1.2.3.tar.gz` -> `package-1.2.3.tar.zst`.
> However, filenames with letters after the numbers will be removed especially for version part
> of the filenames are tagged as `alpha` or `beta`. For example, `package-1.2.3.alpha.tar.gz` will
> turn into `package-1.2.3.tar.zst`. This is a limitation with the renaming logic. The solution is
> to use the `-R` or `--rename` flag to hardcode the new name. So a command like
> ```
> recomprizz -t package-1.2.3.alpha.tar.gz -R package-1.2.3.alpha
> ```
> should fix the issue. **However, I think the better option is to just hardcode it, regardless**.

# Service files are in the following with descriptions.

- [raw.service](./raw.service)
- [recomprizz.service](./recomprizz.service)
- [roast_scm.service](./roast_scm.service)
- [roast.service](./roast.service)

It maps when you run the following commands
- `raw -h`
- `recomprizz -h`
- `roast -h`
- `roast_scm -h`
