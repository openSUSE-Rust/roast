Create archive tarballs and roast them!

## Reason of existence

I am trying to split the logic from [obs-service-cargo](https://github.com/openSUSE-Rust/obs-service-cargo).
Not only is this a library, it also contains binaries that extract and decompress tarballs or create
tarballs with the available highest level compression for supported compression formats.

Plus, it has the comfort of being a simple `tar` alternative.

# How to install the binaries

Roast contains to binaries
- `roast`
- `raw`
- `recomprizz`

## Cargo

**From source**:
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/openSUSE-Rust/roast
```

**From crates.io**:
```bash
cargo install roast-cli
```

Both commands pull from source. The only difference is that the first one
obviously relies on git.

## Roast - How it works

There are three path behaviours in Roast.
- excluded paths
- additional paths
- included paths

Excluded paths and included paths are **within** the source or target
directory. For example. If we are going to archive the `roast-cli` directory
here, declared paths in the `--exclude` and `--include` paths are relative
to the top-most level directory of the source or target directory e.g. `src/bin/roast.rs`
points to `roast-cli/src/bin/roast.rs`.

One thing to note about the path behaviours is the higher precedence over files than directories.

- If a **directory is INCLUDED while EXCLUDED**, it is, therefore, **IGNORED**.
- If a **file is INCLUDED but it is WITHIN an EXCLUDED directory**, it is,
therefore, **ADDED with the directory created if directory (new parent of
the file) does not exist**.
- If a **directory is ADDED i.e. from outside but resulting destination should
be EXCLUDED**, it is, therefore, **ADDED**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ADDED != INCLUDED. ADDED can either point to any path. INCLUDED always points WITHIN
> the top-most level directory of the source or target directory.

> [!NOTE]
> The reasoning behind the **third point** is that the user may have intended to
use a different source or to include only a specific set of files, thereby
ignoring the top-level directory of the original source.

## CLI Help

```
roast 4.7.0 - Archiver with high-level compression

roast [OPTIONS] --target <TARGET> --outfile <OUTFILE>

Options:
  -t, --target <TARGET>
          Target directory to archive. This will be set as the root directory of the archive. Supports globbing.
  -i, --include <INCLUDE>
          Additional paths such as files or directories in the target directory to include to the archive. Their parent directory will be put next to the target directory's work directory. The work directory is based on the preserve root option. This is different from `--additional_paths`. Useful to override excluded directories. ⚠️ Careful if the archive has whether preserved root set when it was created.
  -E, --exclude <EXCLUDE>
          Additional paths such as files or directories from within target directory's work directory to exclude when generating the archive.
  -A, --additional-paths <ADDITIONAL_PATHS>
          Additional paths such as files or directories to add to the archive. Their parent directory will be put next to the target directory. This is different from `--include`. Optionally, one can add a path to a directory inside the archive e.g. `-A some/file/to/archive,put/where/in/archive`. If directory does not exist, it will be created.
  -f, --outfile <OUTFILE>
          Output file of the generated archive with path.
  -d, --outdir <OUTDIR>
          Output path of extracted archive.
  -p, --preserve-root <PRESERVE_ROOT>
          Preserve root directory instead of only archiving relative paths. [default: false] [possible values: true, false]
  -r, --reproducible <REPRODUCIBLE>
          Allow reproducibility for Reproducible Builds. [default: false] [possible values: true, false]
  -g, --ignore-git <IGNORE_GIT>
          Whether to ignore git related metadata, files and directories. [default: true] [possible values: true, false]
  -I, --ignore-hidden <IGNORE_HIDDEN>
          Whether to ignore hidden directories and files or what we call dotfiles. Does not affect `--ignore-git`. [default: false] [possible values: true, false]
  -h, --help
          Print help (see more with '--help')
  -V, --version
          Print version

raw 4.7.0 - Raw extractor and decompressor

raw [OPTIONS] --target <TARGET>

Options:
  -t, --target <TARGET>  Target tarball file to extract and decompress. Supports globbing.
  -d, --outdir <OUTDIR>  Output directory of extracted archive.
  -h, --help             Print help (see more with '--help')
  -V, --version          Print version

recomprizz 4.7.0 - Recompress to other compression formats

recomprizz [OPTIONS] --target <TARGET>

Options:
  -t, --target <TARGET>
          Target tarball file to extract and recompress. Supports globbing.
  -i, --include <INCLUDE>
          Additional paths such as files or directories in the target directory to include to the archive. Their parent directory will be put next to the target directory's work directory. The work directory is based on the preserve root option. This is different from `--additional_paths`. Useful to override excluded directories.
  -E, --exclude <EXCLUDE>
          Additional paths such as files or directories from within target directory's work directory to exclude when generating the archive. ⚠️ Careful if the archive has whether preserved root set when it was created.
  -A, --additional-paths <ADDITIONAL_PATHS>
          Additional paths such as files or directories to add to the archive. Their parent directory will be put next to the target directory. This is different from `--include`. Optionally, one can add a path to a directory inside the archive e.g. `-A some/file/to/archive,put/where/in/archive`. If directory does not exist, it will be created.
  -d, --outdir <OUTDIR>
          Output directory of recompressed archive.
  -c, --compression <COMPRESSION>
          Compression to use. [default: zst] [possible values: gz, xz, zst, bz2, not]
  -R, --rename <RENAME>
          Use this flag if you want a new filename to use ignoring the new file extension. Omitting this flag will just fallback to basename.
  -r, --reproducible <REPRODUCIBLE>
          Allow reproducibility for Reproducible Builds. [default: false] [possible values: true, false]
  -g, --ignore-git <IGNORE_GIT>
          Whether to ignore git related metadata, files and directories. [default: true] [possible values: true, false]
